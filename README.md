**# CS-300---Analysis-and-DesignWhat was the problem you were trying to solve in your course?**
The main goal of this course appeared to be understanding different data structures and how they apply to applications; balancing time taken by each data retrieval method, security each provide, and simplicity of developing. Then applying what we 
learned to the final programing assignment for the course.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**
Project 7-2’s requirements asked us to parse data from a file, store the information, retrieve the information and then print it. When approaching this, I initially asked myself what information specifically needed to be stored: general information, personally identifiable information, etc… This helped me make the decision on what type of data structure I implemented within this project. Seeing as the information being stored  didn’t really need to be secure, That helped me rule out a hash table data structure. This left a vector based or binary search tree data structure or some combination of both. I opted a combination of both, using a Binary search tree structure to store courses and their prerequisites and then using a Vector structure to store course prerequisites for each course.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**
I had a few roadblocks when going through the materials:
The majority of the roadblocks that were encountered with this project I overcame using resources from YouTube,  Stack overflow, Geeks for Geeks and a C++ learning application on my phone.
When beginning the course I specifically had trouble with the programming: having never programmed in C++. I overcame it quickly by just diving into the content and fooling around with it. 
During the activities, and the projects I ended up falling behind due to life circumstances. Communicating with the instructor to the best of my ability and being persistent with trying to accomplish the course material, I made it through.
**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**
My experience with this project and the associated assignments made me realize that:
The major programming languages that I’ve been exposed to, really handle the code in a similar way. So picking up a programming language really wasn’t as difficult as I thought it would be, and makes me feel less anxious about learning a new programming language based on what I already know about other languages.
Pseudocode helps clarify operation of functions by providing a commented description of what needs to happen in each and then textually playing with what it needed to do. Actual code that you write doesn’t need to reflect the pseudocode that we write, it just needs to get the general idea across. If you keep your pseudocode vague enough, it can be applied to what ever language helping you flesh out ideas.                                                                                                      
**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
Next time around, I think what this project has taught me is that integrating “cout” code to see what is being passed along will help troubleshoot issues, commenting them out, and then uncommenting them if you get undesirable results when you compile your program so you can see what exactly is going on within my program.

**Other Thoughts:**
This was my first go around at really trying to use C++, so it was really an intimidating experience at first. After a couple of weeks working with the language, my comfort level increased and it became easier to visualize what really was going on.
Being patient and really working with your program from the start of a process through to the end helps figure out exactly what is going on with the data in your program. In the 7-2 Project, specifically, taking my time and going from switch case to class functions and then from class functions to general program functions which weren’t class specific really helped understand what was actually going on. 
This term I had a lot of stuff happened: My family adopted a dog, my car broke down, I attempted to fix my car and then we purchased a different car. Communicate what is happening! Without communication, there will be no understanding of issues.
